To use the application you need to install the database tables needed. The functions for this can be uncommented and executed from the "dbtools.php" file.

You will then have to manually add a user to the database. You only need to add a username and a password (these are unhashed!). Once a user is added you can log on to the application with that user.

A lot of the database functions aren't in use, but might come in use in the future.

To use the application once it is running:

1. Add your desired words to get news by in the input field and press Enter or click the plus sign
2. Remove unwanted words by pressing the X in the corner of the word
3. Browse the news feed at your own leisure

Have fun!
